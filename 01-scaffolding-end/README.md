# Scaffolding - Solution

If you look through the solution folder, you'll see all of the directories and
files mentioned in the lesson (no surprise). You'll also see a bunch of
`.gitkeep` files. These are just a common convention to force git to commit a
directory with no content. We'll delete these as we put real files in the
directories, so you can just ignore them for now.

If your repo matches the layout here and you feel confident you understand the
decisions behind the layout, you can move to the
[next lesson](../02-first-model-begin).
