Welcome to my tutorial on how I write Go services! I wrote this course after
nearly eight years of writing production Go services in an enterprise software
shop. I don't profess to be any kind of authority on Go, web services, or
development in general, but within this repo you'll find most of the design
decisions I've settled on from a lot of trial and not a little bit of error.
Hopefully it serves as a meaningful reference to somebody and if not, it was
still an interesting experience to evaluate everything I've done for the past
decade and justify it to myself. Now on the course!

> NOTE

> This course doesn't include any instructions on getting setup. My assumption
> is that you are a reasonably independent developer looking for information on
> specific practices that have worked in production. If you're looking for a
> more beginner-oriented tutorial, there are plenty of high-quality sources of
> information for the aspiring Go developer. I'll link the ones I've found to be
> the most informative in the [resources](#resources) section below.
